Copy CD quality (44.100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit quality) .wav or .mp3 files to /convolution/media/music (.wav files will work faster), or change rootpath in kivy file
convolver.kv -> LoadDialog -> BoxLayout - FileChooserIconList -> rootpath, to folder in which you keep your music files.

Have your music files in [i]Artis[/i] - [i]Song name[/i].wav/.mp3 format and it also helps if you have Album and Genre metadata set.
